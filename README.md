# Memory Jogger

![Memory Jogger CI](https://github.com/rgardner/memory-jogger/workflows/Memory%20Jogger%20CI/badge.svg)

Finds items from your [Pocket][pocket] library that are
relevant to trending news. I have thousands of unread Pocket items and Memory
Jogger enables me to find new meaning in articles and videos I saved years
ago. I deployed Memory Jogger to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and set up
a daily job to email me unread Pocket items based on [Google
Trends][google-trends] results from the past two days. Memory Jogger is written
in [Rust][rust].

## Getting Started

Memory Jogger can be installed and run locally or deployed to a server.

### Server Setup

See [docs/heroku.md](docs/heroku.md) for instructions on deploying Memory
Jogger to Heroku.

### Local Setup

#### Local Installation

By default, Memory Jogger requires
[`libpq`](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and
[`sqlite`](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/). Once
these dependencies are installed, you can install Memory Jogger locally via
Rust's package manager, `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/rgardner/memory-jogger.git
```

To install with SQLite support only:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/rgardner/memory-jogger.git --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

To install with PostgreSQL support only:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/rgardner/memory-jogger.git --no-default-features --features postgres
```

#### Local Next Steps

Once Memory Jogger is installed, you need to setup the database, get a Pocket
user access token, and create the user in the database.

```sh
# For SQLite
export DATABASE_URL=<path/to/sqlite_db.db>
# For PostgreSQL
export DATABASE_URL=<postgres_connection_string>
```

With the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set, Memory Jogger will create
and/or configure the database on start-up.

Next, obtain a [Pocket][pocket] app consumer key by creating an application
in their [Developer Portal](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/):

- Permissions: Retrieve
- Platforms: Desktop (other)

Set the `MEMORY_JOGGER_POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY` environment variable to the
obtained consumer key.

Finally, create a user and set their Pocket access token.

```sh
$ memory_jogger pocket auth
Follow URL to authorize application: https://getpocket.com/auth/authorize?request_token=<redacted_request_token>&redirect_uri=memory_jogger%3Afinishauth
Press enter to continue

<redacted_user_access_token>
$ memory_jogger db user add --email <your_email> --pocket-access-token <redacted_user_access_token>
id: 1
```

With the required setup complete, try out Memory Jogger:

```sh
memory_jogger relevant --user-id <user_id, 1 above>
```

### Email Setup

Email setup is optional and typically used when running Memory Jogger on a
server. Memory Jogger uses [SendGrid][sendgrid] internally for sending
emails. Create an account on the [SendGrid][sendgrid] website and then set
the `MEMORY_JOGGER_SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable to your SendGrid API
key.

## Contributing

Memory Jogger is a typical [Rust][rust] application and can be built and tested
via `cargo` (e.g. `cargo build`, `cargo test`). Optionally, install
[Invoke][pyinvoke] for Python 3.8+ to run other custom builds tasks:

```sh
$ invoke --list
Available tasks:

  build   Builds Memory Jogger.
  clean   Removes built artifacts.
  fmt     Runs rustfmt on all source files.
  lint    Performs clippy on all source files.
  test    Runs all tests.
```

[Large](https://testing.googleblog.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html) tests are
disabled by default as they are slow and require [Pocket][pocket] test
credentials. Create a separate Pocket application in the [Pocket Developer
Portal](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/):

- Permissions: Add, Modify, Retrieve
- Platforms: Desktop (other)

Then, create a test Pocket account and authorize the test application:

```sh
MEMORY_JOGGER_POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY=<test_pocket_consumer_key> memory_jogger pocket auth
```

Finally, set the environment variables and enable the `large_tests` Cargo
feature:

```sh
export MEMORY_JOGGER_TEST_POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY=<test_pocket_consumer_key>
export MEMORY_JOGGER_TEST_POCKET_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<test_pocket_user_access_token>
export PG_DATABASE_URL=<pg_database_connection_if_postgres_feature_enabled>
cargo test --features large_tests
```
